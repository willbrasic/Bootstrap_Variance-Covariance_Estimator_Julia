# Bootstrap_Variance-Covariance_Estimator_Julia
The purpose of this program is to simulate data and construct the
bootstrap and wild bootstrap variance-covariance matrix. Then,
I construct the empirical T and empirical Wald statistic distributions
to conduct hypothesis tests with the bootstrap and wild bootstrap p-values.
